This is the source code for the Xircom/Netwave AirSurfer Wireless LAN PC Card driver for Linux. 

I'm adding the driver here since I got a request for the code. 

I made the original version in 1996. Dag Brattli and David Hinds joined in and improved the code further. The code below is the latest snapshot I found on my hard drive and should correspond to the driver that was included in the Linux kernel. 

We no longer have any wireless cards at the department.
